# VIMSandLADEE
This repository contains code I wrote to process Cassini occultation data from the VIMS instrument. It also containts code I wrote to process data from the LADEE UVS instrument.

## VIMS
These are Python scripts and associated input files that were used to process data from the Cassini VIMS instrument. In particular, occultations were used by the VIMS instrument to study the composition and structure of ring system of Saturn.

## LADEE
These are Python scripts and associated input files that were used to process data from LADEE UVS instrument. Solar occultations were used to study the composition of the moon's exosphere.
